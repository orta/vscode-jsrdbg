# vscode-jsrdbg README

This is a mostly, kinda, probably would work vscode extension which connects to jsrdbg sessions. It's highly based on the work done in [vscode-janus-debug](https://gitlab.otris.de/tools/vscode-janus-debug/-/blob/master/AUTHORS.md). 

Blocked because I can't get jsrdbg running on a modern Ubuntu version (elementaryOS 6 aka Ubuntu 16)
